Description:
     A simple mod that aims to make the HW1 races more competetive with the HW2 races. Hopefully, this mod will become obsolete very soon when gearbox starts working on balance. If not, I will go about balancing the races a bit more elegantly. 


     Right now, it gives signifigant health buffs to HW1 strikecraft with a few movement tweaks so they can trade vs their HW2 opposites. It also slightly buffs HW1 capital ship health and strongly emphasizes their front-facing nature by giving them signifigant forward armor (~25% damage reduction) and weaker rear armor. A properly positioned HW1 capital fleet will beat an equal HW2 fleet, but a flanking/backstabbing attack from the HW2 fleet will win by a large margin.
